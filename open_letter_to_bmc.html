            We write to you on behalf of the British climbing community, 75,000+ of whom have a membership with the British Mountaineering Council.
            And we write to you with a clear request: sanction the Israeli Association for Sport Climbing and Mountaineering (ILCA),
            and appeal to the IFSC and UIAA to do the same.</p>
          <p>We remind you at this point of the BMC&rsquo;s 2022 letter to the <a href="https://www.thebmc.co.uk/media/files/international/IFSCMar22.pdf">IFSC</a>
             and <a href="https://www.thebmc.co.uk/media/files/international/UIAAMarch2022.pdf">UIAA</a>,
            in which the BMC departs from its ordinarily apolitical stance, stating a total sanctioning of Russia and Belarus in climbing
            competitions. We implore the BMC to make this departure once again.</p>
          <p>
            In reference to Russia, the letter states; &ldquo;We do not believe that we can sit by and watch this atrocity unfold&rdquo;.
            Indeed, we could not. And, again, we cannot sit by and watch Israel&rsquo;s equally calculated atrocity unfold.
            To suggest otherwise - to render the above statement applicable to one population&rsquo;s suffering while ignoring another -
            would be tantamount to a chilling hierarchising of the value of human lives.</p>
          <p>
            For more than four months, Israel has waged a genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.
            To date, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3s_MCVMCXj/">reports</a> that 38,066 Palestinians have been murdered,
            22,970 of those women and children. Countless bodies lie under the rubble.</p>
          <p>
            The indiscriminate bombing campaign and multiple ground offensives aside, Israel makes no secret of its intention to weaponise the requirements
            for human survival. It is ensuring that starvation, spread of disease, and lack of medical supplies accelerates the erasure of the Gazan population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Israel&rsquo;s blatant disregard for human decency and empathy is utterly condemnable. We list here some of the most heinous examples of
            Israel&rsquo;s violation of international law and international humanitarian law since 7/10.&ast;</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list">
              UNICEF has <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/war-children-resumes-geneva-palais-briefing-note">named</a>
              Israel&rsquo;s attack on Gaza a &ldquo;war on children&rdquo; with an average of 160 children being killed a day.&ast;
              The deliberate targeting of children is both a war crime and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute of the ICC.&ast;
              These deaths are not only the result of airstrikes; a number of videos circulating show the devastating impact of Israel having
              cut off electricity and fuel as well as forcing staff to evacuate. Infants have been left to die alone in multiple hospitals including
              <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/11/1143497">al-Shifa</a> and

              Blocking humanitarian relief and weaponising starvation is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the ICC,

              that the last time food was delivered to northern Gaza was 23rd January.
              And there are currently multiple satellite images trending on social media

              as reported by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/lebanon-evidence-of-israels-unlawful-use-of-white-phosphorus-in-southern-lebanon-as-cross-border-hostilities-escalate/">Amnesty International</a>

              Israel&rsquo;s bombing of schools, universities and hospitals - protected sites under international humanitarian law -
              has been unprecedented in scale, with Israel offering a

              23 hospitals in Gaza are not functioning at all, with 12 partially functioning.

              Israel&rsquo;s intentions have been clear from the beginning, proving intent towards the &ldquo;serious risk of genocide&rdquo;

              warned the international community of only seven days into the attack on Gaza.&ast; To date, these have been some of the
              most chilling uses of genocidal language:

            Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/">writes</a>
            that &ldquo;The legacy of Israel&rsquo;s [56]-year occupation of the Palestinian territories has been systematic human
            rights violations on a mass scale&rdquo;.* For Gaza, the withdrawal of troops and settlers in 2005 did not result in any
            level of liberation. Instead, the siege intensified, with Israel imposing sea and air blockades, along with the construction
            of its 60km &ldquo;Iron Wall&rdquo;, stretching the entire boundary between Israel and the Gaza strip. In the West Bank,
            the occupation continues to the present day with illegal settlements mushrooming alongside increased

            in place, and a horrifying number of children <a href="https://time.com/6366734/palestinian-child-detainees/">abducted</a>
            by the Israeli army every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our letter comes at a critical juncture; Israel&rsquo;s plans for an imminent ground offensive in Rafah is
            the most screamingly acute example of a State hell-bent on the elimination of one population in favour of its own.
            Like bullies in a playground, Israel has cornered over a million Palestinians in a place it once -
            in an act of malicious gaslighting - designated a &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo;.
            The potential consequences of this offensive are too significant to comprehend.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Russia, and indeed apartheid South Africa, as precedents, it is clear that the only appropriate response
            of any sporting community to Israel&rsquo;s deplorable actions is to suspend the State from all global and European sporting events.
            To quote the BMC&rsquo;s letter in reference to Russia once more; &ldquo;the international community [can] not stand idly by in the face of such aggression&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <p>
            We remind the BMC of its <a href="https://www.thebmc.co.uk/bmc-equity-statement">commitment</a>
            to equality, as described in its equity statement.
            This commitment necessarily compels action against egregious racist and fascist behaviour, such as that of Israel&rsquo;s.
            And such a commitment must also extend to the well-being and safety of climbers worldwide.
            The Palestinian climbing community is undergoing a period of accelerated change and restriction in the West Bank in response to 7/10.
            It is further inhibiting their ability to climb and live freely. For us to truly uphold the values of fair treatment and equal opportunities,
            we must not leave that community behind.</p>
          <p>
            Make no mistake, the present moment is unlike any we have witnessed before. This is the world&rsquo;s first livestreamed genocide.
            It is replete with traumatic coverage of civilian slaughter, complemented by what is now described as snuff content, gleefully uploaded by Israeli
            soldiers to social media channels. Inaction in the face of such unflinching evidence of injustice can only be interpreted as complicity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, the IFSC recently admitted Palestine as a member. This indicates a welcome shift in paradigm that we urge the BMC to use as an
            opportunity to outline a firm stance. We request that the BMC refuse to host Israeli delegates in British competitions, abstain from
            competing anywhere where athletes can take part under the name of Israel, and cut ties with any sponsorship linked to Israel.
            Let the IFSC know that, in no uncertain terms, the British climbing community stands against genocide and ethnic cleansing.
            The green light that Israel has enjoyed thus far must be turned red.
          </p>
